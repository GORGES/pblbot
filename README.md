Pebble code used for Pebble Developer Retreat 2014 for robot soccer competition


From Luke
=========
Most of the night we were just using the example code from https://github.com/pebble-hacks/devretreat14/blob/master/pebblebots/lightblue-bean/pebblebot/pebblebot.ino 

The left and right pins for the servos need to be inverted and I changed the sleep to 2ms from 100ms.
